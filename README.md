# Customer Churn Analysis
&nbsp;&nbsp;Analysis customer churn dataset and concluding which variables has the most influence on it. Churn is the right of customers to choose and subscribe a proper provider for them and leave the previous provider.\
Customer churn dataset contains 20 column variables, such as:
* state 
* account length
* area_code
* international_plan
* voice_mail
* number_vmail_messages
* total_day_minutes
* total_day_calls
* total_day_charge
* total_eve_minutes
* total_eve_calls
* total_eve_charge
* total_night_minutes
* total_night_calls
* total_night_charge
* total_intl_minutes
* total_intl_calls
* total_intl_charge
* number_customer_service_calls
* churn

&nbsp;&nbsp;In this analysis, I conducted EDA and data preprocessing before modelling machine learning. Classifier algorithm is used for analysis the dataset. I modelled 3 classifier algorithms, such as, Support Vector Classifier, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. *Recall metrics* is used for evaluation of the model. Based on the result, Random Forest model has the best recall score, that is  *82.17%*. In the future, this model can be improved again.
